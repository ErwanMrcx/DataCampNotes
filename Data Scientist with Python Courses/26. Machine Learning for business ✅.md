## De quoi est composé la data science?
- Draw causal insights
	- What is cuasing our custimers to cancel their subcription ?
- predict futur events
	- Which customers are likely to cancel their subscription next month?
- Understand patterns in data
	- Are there groups of customers who are similar and use our services in similar way?

## Types de machine learning

- - Supervised ml = quand l'algorithme s'entraine sur un dataset ou l'output est connu. Par exemple, detection de fraude = récupération de l'historique de fraude
- - Unsupervised learning = l'algorithme ne connait pas l'output. Il doit donc trouver un pattern dans les data pour donné un résultat

## Qu'est ce que la prediction vs inference

Inference :
	- The goal is to understand fthe drivers of a business outcome
	- inference focused models are interpretable
	- less accurate than prediction models
Prediction:
	- The prediction itself is the main goal
	- Are not easily interpretable and work like black boxes
	- much more accurate


### Inference models

Causality : identify causal relationship affect an outcome of interest. Answer to the question why?

Prefered when there are no early ideas in the experimentations.

### Predictions

#### Supervised models = vairiable cible

- Classification : Target is categorical outcome. Learn rules to predict this unseen data. Give probability on if classification its true or flase

- Regression : Target variable is continous (number of product purchases). Same thing but for trained numbers. Example next month spend

#### Unsupervised models = non target cible

- Clustering: grouping observation in a similar groups or clusters. Identify similar segments of customers. 

- Anomaly detection: detecting which observations out of regular pattern (use it as an input in supervised learning ou business inputs).

- Recommender engines: recommending products.

## Business requirements and model design

Scoping business needs. Asking the right questions:

- Why has churn started increasing?
- Which information indicates potential transaction fraud?
- How are our most valuable customers different form others?

- Can we identify customers at risk?

### Model performance measurement

- Supervised learning metrics:
	- Accuracy --> classification
	- Error --> regression (MSE, RMSE)
	- classification --> Accuracy, recall, precision


- Unsupervised learning metrics:
	A/B testing - actionable models

## Machine learning risks

### Poor performance
- Low precision (lot of flase positive)
- Low recall (need improve the model)
- Large error

Run tests / experiments to validete the performance

How to test the model : A/B test
What if tests don't work: get more data

## Machine learning mistakes
1. Machine learning first (check comment est structuré le service de data science)
2. Target variable definition
3. Feature selection (choose variables that you can control, business have to be involved)
4. Prediction (can we estimate the target variable)
	1. Start with readily available data
	2. model performance is ok, test on market
	3. introduce new features

## Communication management
- Working groups - tracks progress
- inference vs prediction
- Market testing

## Machine learning in production
- Customer relationship management: si le client est considéré comme à risque alors envoyer des mails de rétention
- Online banking system

1. Murphy's law
2. Essayer sur des petits subset
3. track results, performance, stability and customer feedbacké
