### Introduction

In this section, we will explore the basics of data merging in pandas. We will learn how to merge DataFrames based on specific columns, handle overlapping columns, perform inner joins, merge multiple tables, and more.

### Merging on a Specific Column

When merging DataFrames, it is important to choose the appropriate column to merge on. In this exercise, we will merge two tables, taxi_owners and taxi_veh, and select the correct column to merge on.

```python
import pandas as pd

taxi_owners = pd.read_pickle('path_to_taxi_owners.pkl')
taxi_veh = pd.read_pickle('path_to_taxi_veh.pkl')

# Choose the column to merge on
merged_table = taxi_owners.merge(taxi_veh, on='vid')

# Print the merged table
print(merged_table.head())

```

### Handling Overlapping Columns

When merging DataFrames, it is common to have overlapping column names. We can handle this by specifying suffixes for the overlapping columns.

```python
# Merge DataFrames with overlapping columns
merged_table = taxi_owners.merge(taxi_veh, on='vid', suffixes=('_own', '_veh'))

# Print the merged table
print(merged_table.head())

```

### Inner Join and Number of Rows Returned

Inner join is a type of merge that returns only the rows with matching values in both tables. We can examine the number of rows returned after an inner join.

```python
wards = pd.read_pickle('path_to_wards.pkl')
census = pd.read_pickle('path_to_census.pkl')

# Perform inner join
wards_census = wards.merge(census, on='ward', how='inner')

# Print the number of rows in the merged table
print("Number of rows in the merged table:", wards_census.shape[0])

```

### One-to-Many Merge

In a one-to-many merge, a row in the left table can be repeated if it is related to multiple rows in the right table. We will explore this concept by merging the licenses and biz_owners tables and analyzing the most common business owner title.

```python
biz_owners = pd.read_pickle('path_to_biz_owners.pkl')
licenses = pd.read_pickle('path_to_licenses.pkl')

# Merge licenses and biz_owners tables
licenses_owners = licenses.merge(biz_owners, on='account')

# Count the number of accounts for each title
title_counts = licenses_owners['title'].value_counts()

# Print the most common title
print("Most common business owner title:", title_counts.idxmax())

```

### Total Riders in a Month

To analyze the total number of rides provided to passengers passing through the Wilson station on weekdays in July, we need to merge three tables: ridership, cal, and stations.

```python
stations = pd.read_pickle('path_to_stations.pkl')
ridership = pd.read_pickle('path_to_ridership.pkl')
cal = pd.read_pickle('path_to_cal.pkl')

# Merge ridership and cal tables
ridership_cal = ridership.merge(cal, on=['year', 'month', 'day'])

# Merge ridership_cal and stations tables
ridership_cal_stations = ridership_cal.merge(stations, on='station_id')

# Filter for desired criteria
filter_criteria = ((ridership_cal_stations['month'] ==

7)
                   & (ridership_cal_stations['day_type'] == 'Weekday')
                   & (ridership_cal_stations['station_name'] == 'Wilson'))

# Calculate the total number of rides
total_rides = ridership_cal_stations.loc[filter_criteria, 'rides'].sum()

print("Total number of rides in July on weekdays at Wilson station:", total_rides)

```

### Three Table Merge

In this exercise, we will merge three tables to analyze the median income by alderman in Chicago. We will merge the licenses, zip_demo, and wards tables.

```python
zip_demo = pd.read_pickle('path_to_zip_demo.pkl')

# Merge licenses, zip_demo, and wards tables
licenses_zip_ward = licenses.merge(zip_demo, on='zip').merge(wards, on='ward')

# Group by alderman and calculate median income
median_income = licenses_zip_ward.groupby('alderman')['income'].median()

# Print the median income by alderman
print(median_income)

```

### One-to-Many Merge with Multiple Tables

To choose a location for a goat farm, we will perform a one-to-many merge with multiple tables. We will merge the land_use, census, and licenses tables.

```python
land_use = pd.read_pickle('path_to_land_use.pkl')

# Merge land_use, census, and licenses tables
land_cen_lic = land_use.merge(census, on='ward').merge(licenses, on='ward', suffixes=('_cen', '_lic'))

# Group by ward, pop_2010, and vacant and count the number of accounts
pop_vac_lic = land_cen_lic.groupby(['ward', 'pop_2010', 'vacant']).agg({'account': 'count'})

# Sort by vacant, account, and pop_2010
sorted_pop_vac_lic = pop_vac_lic.sort_values(['vacant', 'account', 'pop_2010'], ascending=[False, True, True])

# Print the sorted results
print(sorted_pop_vac_lic.head())

```

Congratulations! You have learned the basics of data merging in pandas. These techniques will help you combine and analyze data from multiple sources efficiently.

### Counting missing rows with left join

The Movie Database is supported by volunteers going out into the world, collecting data, and entering it into the database. This includes financial data, such as movie budget and revenue. If you wanted to know which movies are still missing data, you could use a left join to identify them. Practice using a left join by merging the movies table and the financials table.

```python
import pandas as pd

financials = pd.read_pickle('path_to_financials.pkl')
movies = pd.read_pickle('path_to_movies.pkl')

# Merge the movies table with the financials table with a left join
movies_financials = movies.merge(financials, on='id', how='left')

# Count the number of rows in the budget column that are missing
number_of_missing_fin = movies_financials['budget'].isnull().sum()

# Print the number of movies missing financials
print(number_of_missing_fin)

```

### Enriching a dataset

Setting `how='left'` with the `.merge()` method is a useful technique for enriching or enhancing a dataset with additional information from a different table. In this exercise, you will start off with a sample of movie data from the movie series "Toy Story". Your goal is to enrich this data by adding the marketing tag line for each movie. You will compare the results of a left join versus an inner join.

```python
toy_story = pd.read_pickle('path_to_toy_story.pkl')
taglines = pd.read_pickle('path_to_taglines.pkl')

# Merge the toy_story and taglines tables with a left join
toystory_tag = toy_story.merge(taglines, on='id', how='left')

# Print the rows and shape of toystory_tag
print(toystory_tag)
print(toystory_tag.shape)

```

With `toy_story` as the left table, merge it to `taglines` on the `id` column with an inner join, and save it as `toystory_tag`.

```python
# Merge the toy_story and taglines tables with an inner join
toystory_tag = toy_story.merge(taglines, on='id', how='inner')

# Print the rows and shape of toystory_tag
print(toystory_tag)
print(toystory_tag.shape)

```

### Popular genres with right join

What are the genres of the most popular movies? To answer this question, you need to merge data from the `movies` and `movie_to_genres` tables. In a table called `pop_movies`, the top 10 most popular movies in the `movies` table have been selected. To ensure that you are analyzing all of the popular movies, merge it with the `movie_to_genres` table using a right join. To complete your analysis, count the number of different genres. Also, the two tables can be merged by the movie ID. However, in `pop_movies` that column is called `id`, and in `movies_to_genres` it's called `movie_id`.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

pop_movies = pd.read_pickle('path_to_pop_movies.pkl')
movie_to_genres = pd.read_pickle('path_to_movie_to_genres.pkl')

# Merge `movies` and `movie_to_genres` on index with right join
genres_movies = movie_to_genres.merge(pop_movies, how='

right', left_index=True, right_index=True)

# Count the number of genres
genre_count = genres_movies.groupby('genre').size()

# Plot a bar chart of the genre_count
genre_count.plot(kind='bar')
plt.show()

```

### Using outer join to select actors

One cool aspect of using an outer join is that, because it returns all rows from both merged tables and null where they do not match, you can use it to find rows that do not have a match in the other table. To try for yourself, you have been given two tables with a list of actors from two popular movies: Iron Man 1 and Iron Man 2. Most of the actors played in both movies. Use an outer join to find actors who did not act in both movies.

The Iron Man 1 table is called `iron_1_actors`, and Iron Man 2 table is called `iron_2_actors`. Both tables have been loaded for you and a few rows printed so you can see the structure.

```python
iron_1_actors = pd.read_pickle('path_to_iron_1_actors.pkl')
iron_2_actors = pd.read_pickle('path_to_iron_2_actors.pkl')

# Merge `iron_1_actors` to `iron_2_actors` on 'id' with outer join
iron_1_and_2 = iron_1_actors.merge(iron_2_actors, on='id', how='outer')

# Create a Boolean index to select the appropriate rows
boolean_filter = ((iron_1_and_2['name_1'].isnull()) | (iron_1_and_2['name_2'].isnull()))

# Print the first few rows of iron_1_and_2
print(iron_1_and_2[boolean_filter].head())

```

### Self join

Merging a table to itself can be useful when you want to compare values in a column to other values in the same column. In this exercise, you will practice this by creating a table that for each movie will list the movie director and a member of the crew on one row. You have been given a table called `crews`, which has columns `id`, `job`, and `name`. First, merge the table to itself using the movie ID. This merge will give you a larger table where for each movie, every job is matched against each other. Then select only those rows with a director in the left table, and avoid having a row where the director's job is listed in both the left and right tables. This filtering will remove job combinations that aren't with the director.

```python
crews = pd.read_pickle('path_to_crews.pkl')

# Merge `crews` table to itself
crews_self_merged = crews.merge(crews, on='id', how='inner', suffixes=('_dir','_crew'))

# Create a Boolean index to select the appropriate rows
boolean_filter = ((crews_self_merged['job_dir'] == 'Director') & (crews_self_merged['job_crew'] != 'Director'))

# Print the first few rows of `direct_crews`
print(crews_self_merged[boolean_filter].head())

```

### Index merge for movie ratings

To practice merging on indexes, you will merge `movies` and a table called `ratings` that holds information about movie ratings. Make sure your merge returns all of the rows from the `movies` table and not all the rows of `ratings` table need to be included in the result.

```python
ratings = pd.read_pickle('path_to_ratings.pkl')
movies = pd.read_pickle('path_to_movies.pkl')

# Merge to the `movies` table the

 `ratings` table on the index
movies_ratings = movies.merge(ratings, left_index=True, right_index=True, how='left')

# Print the first few rows of `movies_ratings`
print(movies_ratings.head())

```

### Do sequels earn more?

It is time to put together many of the aspects that you have learned in this chapter. In this exercise, you'll find out which movie sequels earned the most compared to the original movie. To answer this question, you will merge a modified version of the `sequels` and `financials` tables where their index is the movie ID. You will need to choose a merge type that will return all of the rows from the `sequels` table and not all the rows of `financials` table need to be included in the result. From there, you will join the resulting table to itself so that you can compare the revenue values of the original movie to the sequel. Next, you will calculate the difference between the two revenues and sort the resulting dataset.

```python
sequels = pd.read_pickle('path_to_sequels.pkl')
financials = pd.read_pickle('path_to_financials.pkl')

# Merge `sequels` and `financials` on index `id`
sequels_fin = sequels.merge(financials, left_index=True, right_index=True, how='left')

# Self merge with suffixes as inner join with left on `sequel` and right on `id`
orig_seq = sequels_fin.merge(sequels_fin, how='inner', left_on='sequel', right_on='id', suffixes=('_org', '_seq'))

# Add calculation to subtract `revenue_org` from `revenue_seq`
orig_seq['diff'] = orig_seq['revenue_seq'] - orig_seq['revenue_org']

# Select the `title_org`, `title_seq`, and `diff` columns
titles_diff = orig_seq[['title_org', 'title_seq', 'diff']]

# Sort `titles_diff` by `diff` in descending order
titles_diff = titles_diff.sort_values(by='diff', ascending=False)

# Print the first few rows of `titles_diff`
print(titles_diff.head())

```

These exercises cover different types of joins and merging techniques in pandas, giving you a good understanding of how to merge tables and perform operations on the merged data.

In this section, we will explore advanced techniques for merging and concatenating data using pandas. We will cover topics such as performing semi joins, anti joins, and concatenation with keys. These techniques are useful for combining and manipulating data from multiple sources.

8. Concatenating and Merging to Find Common Songs

### 1. Steps of a Semi Join

A semi join filters the left table to only the rows where a match exists in both the left and right tables. The steps to perform a semi join in pandas are as follows:

1. Merge the left and right tables on the key column using an inner join.
2. Search if the key column in the left table is in the merged tables using the `.isin()` method, creating a Boolean Series.
3. Subset the rows of the left table based on the Boolean Series created in the previous step.

Let's see an example:

```python
# Step 1: Merge the left and right tables on the key column using an inner join
merged_tables = left_table.merge(right_table, on='key_column', how='inner')

# Step 2: Search if the key column in the left table is in the merged tables
boolean_series = left_table['key_column'].isin(merged_tables['key_column'])

# Step 3: Subset the rows of the left table
subset_left_table = left_table[boolean_series]

```

### 2. Performing an Anti Join

An anti join returns only the rows from the left table that do not have a match in the right table. This is useful for filtering a main table based on another table. Here's how you can perform an anti join in pandas:

```python
# Merge the left and right tables with a left join, setting indicator argument to True
empl_cust = employees.merge(top_cust, on='srid', how='left', indicator=True)

# Select the srid column where _merge is 'left_only'
srid_list = empl_cust.loc[empl_cust['_merge'] == 'left_only', 'srid']

# Subset the employees table and select those rows where the srid is in the variable srid_list
employees_not_working_with_top_customers = employees[employees['srid'].isin(srid_list)]

# Print the results
print(employees_not_working_with_top_customers)

```

### 3. Performing a Semi Join

A semi join filters a table based on the matching values in another table. Here's an example of performing a semi join in pandas:

```python
# Merge the non_mus_tcks and top_invoices tables on tid
tracks_invoices = non_mus_tcks.merge(top_invoices, on='tid', how='inner')

# Use .isin() to subset non_mus_tcks to rows with tid in tracks_invoices
top_tracks = non_mus_tcks[non_mus_tcks['tid'].isin(tracks_invoices['tid'])]

# Group the top_tracks by gid and count the tid rows
cnt_by_gid = top_tracks.groupby(['gid'], as_index=False).agg({'tid':'count'})

# Merge the genres table to cnt_by_gid on gid and print the result
print(cnt_by_gid.merge(genres, on='gid'))

```

### 4. Concatenation Basics

Concatenation is the process of combining two or more tables either vertically or horizontally. Here are some basic concatenation operations using the `.concat()` method in

pandas:

```python
# Concatenate tracks_master, tracks_ride, and tracks_st vertically, setting sort to True
tracks_from_albums = pd.concat([tracks_master, tracks_ride, tracks_st], sort=True)
print(tracks_from_albums)

# Concatenate tracks_master, tracks_ride, and tracks_st vertically, setting ignore_index to True
tracks_from_albums = pd.concat([tracks_master, tracks_ride, tracks_st], ignore_index=True, sort=True)
print(tracks_from_albums)

# Concatenate tracks_master, tracks_ride, and tracks_st vertically, showing only columns that are in all tables
tracks_from_albums = pd.concat([tracks_master, tracks_ride, tracks_st], join='inner', sort=True)
print(tracks_from_albums)

```

### 5. Concatenating with Keys

Concatenating with keys allows you to add labels to the concatenated tables, creating a hierarchical index. Here's an example of concatenating tables with keys:

```python
# Concatenate the inv_jul, inv_aug, and inv_sep tables vertically, adding keys for each month
inv_jul_thr_sep = pd.concat([inv_jul, inv_aug, inv_sep], keys=['7Jul', '8Aug', '9Sep'])

# Group the invoices by the index keys and find the average of the total column
avg_inv_by_month = inv_jul_thr_sep.groupby(level=0).agg({'total':'mean'})

# Create a bar chart of avg_inv_by_month
avg_inv_by_month.plot(kind='bar')
plt.show()

```

### 6. Using the Append Method

The `.append()` method provides a simpler alternative to `.concat()` when you don't need as much control over the concatenation process. Here's an example of using the `.append()` method:

```python
# Append tracks_ride, tracks_master, and tracks_st together vertically, and save to metallica_tracks
metallica_tracks = tracks_ride.append([tracks_master, tracks_st], sort=False)

# Merge metallica_tracks and invoice_items on tid with an inner join
tracks_invoices = metallica_tracks.merge(invoice_items, on='tid')

# For each tid and name, sum the quantity sold column
tracks_sold = tracks_invoices.groupby(['tid', 'name']).agg({'quantity':'sum'})

# Sort tracks_sold in descending order by the quantity column and print the table
print(tracks_sold.sort_values(['quantity'], ascending=False))

```

### 7. Validating a Merge

When merging two tables using the `.merge()` method, you can specify the `validate` argument to validate the type of merge operation. Here's an example:

```
# Merge the artists and albums tables and adjust the validate argument
merged_data = artists.merge(albums, on='artid', validate='many_to_many').head()
print(merged_data)

```

### 8. Concatenating and Merging to Find Common Songs

In this exercise, we'll concatenate two sets of playlist files and use a semi join to find the most popular songs. Here's an example:

```python
# Concatenate the classic_18 and classic_19 tables vertically and save to classic_18_19
classic_18_19 = pd.concat([classic_18, classic_19], ignore_index=True)

# Concatenate the pop_18 and pop_19 tables vertically and save to pop_18_19
pop_18_19 = pd.concat([pop_18, pop_19], ignore_index=True)

# Merge classic_18_19 with pop_18_19 on tid using an inner join
classic_pop = classic_18_19.merge(pop_18_19, on='tid')

# Use .isin() to filter classic_18_19 rows where tid is in classic_pop
popular_classic = classic_18_19[classic_18_19['tid'].isin(classic_pop['tid'])]

# Print popular_classic
print(popular_classic)

```

Great job! You've now learned advanced techniques for merging and concatenating data using pandas. These skills will be valuable for working with complex datasets and performing data manipulations efficiently.
