# Chapter 1 - Understanding Matplotlib

Data visualization is a pivotal skill for budding data scientists. Matplotlib, a Python library, simplifies the creation of insightful and meaningful plots. In this chapter, we'll learn how to construct various types of plots and how to customize them to enhance their visual appeal and interpretability.

### Section 1: Line Plot (Part 1)

Matplotlib enables us to create a myriad of different plots in Python. Among the most fundamental ones is the line plot. Let's delve into creating one with the following recipe:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()The video in our lesson illustrated the dramatic growth of the world's population over recent years. Is this trend likely to continue? The World Bank has estimates of global population from 1950 to 2100. We've loaded the years into a list called `year` and the corresponding population estimates into a list called `pop`.
```

### Section 2: Line Plot (Part 2)

```python
# Create a line plot with 'gdp_cap' on the x-axis, 'life_exp' on the y-axis
plt.plot(gdp_cap, life_exp)

```

### Section 3: Scatter Plot (Part 1)
While line plots are valuable when you have a time scale along the horizontal axis, scatter plots often prove more useful when trying to assess correlations between two variables. Here is an example of how to generate a scatter plot:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.show()

```

We'll continue with the 'gdp_cap' vs. 'life_exp' plot, which displays GDP and life expectancy data for various countries in 2007. Could a scatter plot be a better alternative?

```python
# Change the line plot below to a scatter plot
plt.scatter(gdp_cap, life_exp)

# Set the x-axis to a logarithmic scale
plt.xscale('log')

```

### Section 5: Histograms (Part 1)
A list called 'life_exp' containing life expectancy data for different countries

```python
plt.hist(x)
plt.show()
```

# Chapter 2 - Dictionnaires and Pandas

Learn about dictionaries, an alternative to Python lists, and Pandas DataFrame, the de facto standard for working with tabular data in Python. Gain hands-on experience in creating, manipulating, and accessing information from these data structures.

### Motivation for Dictionaries

To understand the usefulness of dictionaries, let's consider the following two lists: `countries` containing the names of some European countries, and `capitals` listing the corresponding names of their capitals.

```
countries = ['spain', 'france', 'germany', 'norway']
capitals = ['madrid', 'paris', 'berlin', 'oslo']

```

To retrieve the capital of Germany using the index, we can do the following:

```
ind_ger = countries.index('germany')
print(capitals[ind_ger])  # Output: berlin

```

### Creating a Dictionary

Let's convert the `countries` and `capitals` lists into a dictionary where country names are the keys and capitals are the corresponding values. We'll follow this recipe for creating a dictionary:

```
my_dict = {
   "key1": "value1",
   "key2": "value2",
}
```

In our case, both the keys and values will be strings. Here's how we can create the `europe` dictionary:

```
europe = {'spain': 'madrid', 'france': 'paris', 'germany': 'berlin', 'norway': 'oslo'}
print(europe)  # Output: {'spain': 'madrid', 'france': 'paris', 'germany': 'berlin', 'norway': 'oslo'}
```

### Accessing a Dictionary

Accessing values in a dictionary is easy and intuitive when the keys are chosen wisely. For example, to retrieve the capital of France from the `europe` dictionary, we can use:

```
print(europe['france'])  # Output: paris
```

To print all the keys in the `europe` dictionary, we can use:

```
print(europe.keys())  # Output: dict_keys(['spain', 'france', 'germany', 'norway'])
```

To print the value corresponding to the key 'norway', we can do:

```
print(europe['norway'])  # Output: oslo
```

### Dictionary Manipulation (1)

We can assign new values to a dictionary by accessing it. To add a new key-value pair to `europe`, we can use:

```
europe['iceland'] = 'reykjavik'
```

To add 'italy' to `europe` with the capital 'rome', we can do:

```
europe['italy'] = 'rome'
```

To check if 'italy' is present in `europe`, we can use:

```
print('italy' in europe)  # Output: True
```

To add 'poland' to `europe` with the capital 'warsaw', we can do:

```
europe['poland'] = 'warsaw'

```

Printing the `europe` dictionary will now include 'italy' and 'poland':

```
print(europe)  # Output: {'spain': 'madrid', 'france': 'paris', 'germany': 'berlin', 'norway': 'oslo', 'italy': 'rome', 'poland': 'warsaw'}

```

### Dictionary Manipulation (2)

If the dictionary has incorrect or duplicate values, we can update or remove them using appropriate Python commands. Consider the following adapted version of the `europe` dictionary:

```
europe = {'spain': 'madrid', 'france': 'paris', 'germany': 'bonn', 'norway': 'oslo', 'italy': 'rome', 'poland': 'warsaw', 'australia': 'vienna'}

```

To update the capital of Germany to 'berlin', we can use:

```
europe['germany'] = 'berlin'

```

To remove 'australia' from `europe`, we can do:

```
del(europe['australia'])

```

Printing the `europe` dictionary after the modifications will yield:

```
print(europe)  # Output: {'spain': 'madrid', 'france': 'paris', 'germany': 'berlin', 'norway': 'oslo', 'italy': 'rome', 'poland': 'warsaw'}

```

### Dictionariception

Similar to lists, dictionaries can also contain other dictionaries as values. For instance, let's consider the `europe` dictionary where the keys are country names, and the values are dictionaries containing additional information such as the capital and population.

```
europe = {'spain': {'capital': 'madrid', 'population': 46.77}, 'france': {'capital': 'paris', 'population': 66.03}, 'germany': {'capital': 'berlin', 'population': 80.62}, 'norway': {'capital': 'oslo', 'population': 5.084}}

```

To print the capital of France, we can use:

```
print(europe['france']['capital'])  # Output: paris

```

We can also create a sub-dictionary `data` containing the capital and population of Italy and add it to the `europe` dictionary:

```
data = {'capital': 'rome', 'population': 59.83}
europe['italy'] = data

```

Printing the `europe` dictionary will now include the additional information for Italy:

```
print(europe)  # Output: {'spain': {'capital': 'madrid', 'population': 46.77}, 'france': {'capital': 'paris', 'population': 66.03}, 'germany': {'capital': 'berlin', 'population': 80.62}, 'norway': {'capital': 'oslo', 'population': 5.084}, 'italy': {'capital': 'rome', 'population': 59.83}}

```

### Dictionary to DataFrame (1)

Pandas is a powerful open-source library in Python for data analysis. The DataFrame is one of its essential data structures, allowing you to store tabular data with labeled rows and columns. We can create a DataFrame from a dictionary.

Let's consider vehicle data from different countries with three lists: `names` containing country names, `dr` indicating whether people drive left or right, and `cpc` representing the number of motor vehicles per 1000 people in each country.

```
names = ['United States', 'Australia', 'Japan', 'India', 'Russia', 'Morocco', 'Egypt']
dr = [True, False, False, False, True, True, True]
cpc = [809, 731, 588, 18, 200, 70, 45]

```

To create a DataFrame `cars` from the dictionary `my_dict`,

we can use the following code:

```python
import pandas as pd

my_dict = {'country': names, 'drives_right': dr, 'cars_per_cap': cpc}
cars = pd.DataFrame(my_dict)

print(cars)

```

### Dictionary to DataFrame (2)

When creating a DataFrame, the row labels (index) are automatically set as integers from 0 to N-1. To specify custom row labels, we can use the `index_col` argument of the `read_csv()` function.

If we have a list `row_labels` that contains row labels for the `cars` DataFrame, we can set it as the index using:

```python
row_labels = ['US', 'AUS', 'JAP', 'IN', 'RU', 'MOR', 'EG']
cars.index = row_labels
```

### CSV to DataFrame (1)

When dealing with large datasets, it is often more efficient to import data from CSV files. The `read_csv()` function in Pandas allows us to import CSV data into a DataFrame.

Suppose we have a CSV file named `cars.csv` in the current working directory. We can import its contents into the `cars` DataFrame using the following code:

```python
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv')

print(cars)
```

The output will display the contents of the `cars` DataFrame.

### CSV to DataFrame (2)

When using `read_csv()`, we can specify the column to be used as the row label (index) using the `index_col` argument. This ensures that the row labels are correctly assigned.

To import the `cars.csv` data into the `cars` DataFrame with the first column as the row labels, we can modify the `read_csv()` function as follows:

```python
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col=0)

print(cars)
```

The resulting DataFrame `cars` will have the row labels correctly set.

### Square Brackets (1)

Square brackets are a simple but effective way to select columns from a Pandas DataFrame. To select only the `cars_per_cap` column from the `cars` DataFrame, we can use either of the following syntaxes:

```python
cars['cars_per_cap']
cars[['cars_per_cap']]
```

The single bracket version returns a Pandas Series, while the double bracket version returns a Pandas DataFrame.

To print only the `country` column as a Pandas Series, we can use:

```python
print(cars['country'])

```

To print the `country` column as a Pandas DataFrame, we can use:

```
print(cars[['country']])

```

To print a DataFrame with the `country` and `drives_right` columns, we can do:

```
print(cars[['country', 'drives_right']])
```

In addition to selecting columns, square brackets can also be used to select rows or observations from a DataFrame. To select the first three observations from the `cars` DataFrame, we can use:

```python
cars[0:3]

```

This will return a DataFrame containing only the specified rows.

To print the fourth, fifth, and sixth observations from the `cars` DataFrame, we can use:

```python
cars[3:6]
```

This will return a DataFrame with the selected rows.

### loc and iloc (1)

Using `loc` and `iloc`, you can perform various data selection operations on Pandas DataFrames. `loc` is label-based, meaning that you need to specify rows and columns based on their labels. On the other hand, `iloc` is integer index-based, requiring you to specify rows and columns using their integer indexes.

To select the row corresponding to 'RU' from the `cars` DataFrame using `loc`, we can use:

```
cars.loc['RU']

```

This will return a DataFrame.

Alternatively, we can achieve the same result using `iloc`:

```
cars.iloc[4]

```

This will also return a DataFrame.

To select multiple rows, we can pass a list of labels or indexes. For example, to select rows 'RU' and 'AUS' using `loc`, we can do:

```python
cars.loc[['RU', 'AUS']]

```

Using `iloc`, the equivalent code is:

```
cars.iloc[[4, 1]]

```

### loc and iloc (3)

`loc` and `iloc` also allow you to select specific rows and columns simultaneously from a DataFrame. By providing a slice from beginning to end in front of the comma, you can select all rows or columns.

To select the 'drives_right' column as a Series using `loc`, we can do:

```python
cars.loc[:, 'drives_right']
```

Alternatively, using `iloc`:

```python
cars.iloc[:, 1]
```

To select the 'drives_right' column as a DataFrame using `loc`, we can do:

```python
cars.loc[:, ['drives_right']]
```

Using `iloc`, the equivalent code is:

```python
cars.iloc[:, [1]]
```

To select both the 'cars_per_cap' and 'drives_right' columns as a DataFrame using `loc`, we can do:

```python
cars.loc[:, ['cars_per_cap', 'drives_right']]
```

Using `iloc`, the equivalent code is:

```python
cars.iloc[:, [0, 1]]
```

Congratulations on completing the drill on indexing and selecting data from Pandas DataFrames! Now, it's time to move on to Chapter 3, where you will learn about logic, control flow, and filtering.

Learn about dictionaries, an alternative to Python lists, and Pandas DataFrame, the de facto standard for working with tabular data in Python. Gain hands-on experience in creating, manipulating, and accessing information from these data structures.

# Chapter 3 - Logic, control and flow

### Equality

To check for equality between two Python values or variables, you can use the `==` operator. To check for inequality, you can use the `!=` operator.

```python
print(2 == (1 + 1))  # True
print("intermediate" != "python")  # True
print(True != False)  # True
print("Python" != "python")  # True

```

### Greater and Less Than

To compare if one value is greater than or less than another value, you can use the `>` and `<` operators, respectively. To check for greater than or equal to, you can use `>=`, and for less than or equal to, you can use `<=`.

```python
x = -3 * 6
print(x >= -10)  # False

y = "test"
print("test" <= y)  # True

print(True > False)  # True

```

### Compare Arrays

You can compare arrays using the same comparison operators. When using NumPy arrays, the comparison is element-wise, resulting in a boolean array.

```python
import numpy as np

my_house = np.array([18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50])
your_house = np.array([14.0, 24.0, 14.25, 9.0])

print(my_house >= 18)  # [ True  True False False]
print(my_house < your_house)  # [False  True  True False]

```

### Boolean Operators: and, or, not

Boolean operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) allow you to combine multiple boolean expressions. These operators work with boolean values (`True` and `False`) and can be used to perform more advanced queries.

```python
my_kitchen = 18.0
your_kitchen = 14.0

print(my_kitchen > 10 and my_kitchen > 18)  # False
print(my_kitchen < 14 or my_kitchen > 17)  # True
print(my_kitchen * 2 < your_kitchen * 3)  # True

```

### Operator Precedence

The `not` operator has higher precedence than `and` and `or`. When combining multiple boolean expressions, it's important to consider the operator precedence to ensure correct evaluation.

```python
x = 8
y = 9
result = not(not(x < 3) and not(y > 14 or y > 10))
print(result)  # False

```

### Boolean Operators with NumPy

For boolean operations on NumPy arrays, you need to use the functions `np.logical_and()`, `np.logical_or()`, and `np.logical_not()`.

```
np.logical_and(your_house > 13, your_house < 15)
np.logical_or(my_house > 18.5, my_house < 10)
np.logical_and(my_house < 11, your_house < 11)

```

### if Statement

The `if` statement allows you to execute a block of code conditionally based on a boolean expression. If the condition is `True`, the code inside the `if` block is executed.

```python
room = "kit"
area = 14.0

if room == "kit":
    print("Looking around in the kitchen.")

if area > 15:
    print("Big place!")

```

### if-else Statement

The `if-else` statement extends the `if` statement to execute different code blocks based on the condition. If the condition in

the `if` block is `True`, that block is executed; otherwise, the code inside the `else` block is executed.

```python
if room == "kit":
    print("Looking around in the kitchen.")
else:
    print("Looking around elsewhere.")

if area > 15:
    print("Big place!")
else:
    print("Pretty small.")

```

### Filtering with Boolean Series

You can use a boolean Series to filter a DataFrame based on a certain condition. By selecting the rows where the boolean Series is `True`, you can create a subset of the DataFrame.

```
import pandas as pd

cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col=0)

dr = cars['drives_right']
sel = cars[dr]

print(sel)

```

### Advanced Filtering with NumPy and Boolean Series

You can use NumPy's logical functions (`np.logical_and()`, `np.logical_or()`, `np.logical_not()`) to perform more complex filtering operations on Pandas Series.

```
import numpy as np

cpc = cars['cars_per_cap']
between = np.logical_and(cpc > 10, cpc < 80)
medium = cars[between]

print(medium)

```

### Filtering with Conditions

You can filter a DataFrame directly using conditions without creating a boolean Series.

```
cars[cars['drives_right']]
cars[cars['cars_per_cap'] > 500]

```

# Chapter 4 - Loop

### while: warming up

The `while` loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.

```
x = 1
while x < 4:
    print(x)
    x = x + 1

```

### Basic while loop

In this example, the `while` loop is used to correct an offset. The loop continues until the offset becomes zero.

```
offset = 8

while offset != 0:
    print("correcting...")
    offset -= 1
    print(offset)

```

### Add conditionals

To prevent an infinite loop, you can add conditionals inside the `while` loop. In this example, the offset is decreased if it is greater than zero and increased if it is less than zero.

``` python
offset = -6

while offset != 0:
    print("correcting...")
    if offset > 0:
        offset -= 1
    else:
        offset += 1
    print(offset)

```

### Loop over a list

The `for` loop is used to iterate over the elements of a list.

### Indexes and values (1)

By using the `enumerate()` function, you can iterate over both the indexes and the values of a list.

```python
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

for index, value in enumerate(areas):
    print("room", index, ":", value)

room 0 : 11.25
room 1 : 18.0
room 2 : 20.0
room 3 : 10.75
room 4 : 9.5

```

### Indexes and values (2)

To start the index count from 1 instead of 0, you can add 1 to the index variable.

```python
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

for index, value in enumerate(areas):
    print("room", index + 1, ":", value)

room 1 : 11.25
room 2 : 18.0
room 3 : 20.0
room 4 : 10.75
room 5 : 9.50
```

### Loop over a list of lists

You can use nested loops to iterate over a list of lists. In this example, each sublist contains the name and area of a room.

```python
house = [["hallway", 11.25],
         ["kitchen", 18.0],
         ["living room", 20.0],
         ["bedroom", 10.75],
         ["bathroom", 9.50]]

for name, area in house:
    print("The", name, "is", area, "sqm")
```

### Loop over a dictionary

To iterate over a dictionary, you can use the `items()` method, which returns the key-value pairs of the dictionary.

### Loop over a NumPy array

To loop over a 1D NumPy array, you can use a simple `for` loop. For a 2D NumPy array, you can use `np.nditer()` to iterate over all elements.

```python
import numpy as np

np_height = np.array([74, 74, 72, 72, 73, 69, 69, 71, 76, 71])
np_baseball = np.array([[74, 180], [74, 215], [72, 210]])

for height in np_height:
    print(height)

for x in np.nditer(np_baseball):
    print(x)

74
74
72
72
73
69
69
71
76
71
74
180
74
215
72
210
Output:
```

### Loop over DataFrame

To iterate over the rows of a DataFrame, you can use the `iterrows()` method. It returns an iterator that yields index and row data.

```
import pandas as pd

cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col=0)

for label, row in cars.iterrows():
    print(label)
    print(row)

```

### Loop over DataFrame (2)

You can access specific columns of a DataFrame inside the `iterrows()` loop by using the column names.

```
import pandas as pd

cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col=0)

for label, row in cars.iterrows():
    print(label + ":", row['cars_per_cap'])

```

### Add column

To add a new column to a DataFrame, you can use the indexing operator (`[]`) on the DataFrame and assign values to it.

```
import pandas as pd

cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col=0)

for label, row in cars.iterrows():
    cars.loc[label, 'name_length'] = len(row['country'])

print(cars)

```

Output:

```
   cars_per_cap        country  drives_right  name_length
US           809  United States          True         13.0
AUS          731      Australia         False          9.0
JAP          588          Japan         False          5.0
IN            18          India         False          5.0
RU           200         Russia          True          6.0
MOR           70        Morocco          True          7.0
EG            45          Egypt          True          5.0

```

### Add column (2)

Instead of using `iterrows()`, you can use the `apply()` function to apply a function to each element of a column.

```
import pandas as pd

cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col=0)

cars['COUNTRY'] = cars['country'].apply(str.upper)

print(cars)

```

Output:

```
    cars_per_cap        country  drives_right        COUNTRY
US           809  United States          True  UNITED STATES
AUS          731      Australia         False      AUSTRALIA
JAP          588          Japan         False          JAPAN
IN            18          India         False          INDIA
RU           200         Russia          True         RUSSIA
MOR           70        Morocco          True        MOROCCO
EG            45          Egypt          True          EGYPT

```
